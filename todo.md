## MVP
- [ ] Convert fields to just just be a table
- [ ] Store pieces in Dict Position Piece
- [ ] Correct row / col naming, e.g. (A, 1)
- [ ] Fn for translating e.g. A -> 1
- [ ] Make recursive function to figure return possible moves.
Something that takes a `MoveRestriction` describing how 
many moves are possible in any given direction, and a `(x, y)`
describing distance of a single move a piece, i.e. Horsie would be
`(1, 2)`, Queen would be `(1, 1)`
